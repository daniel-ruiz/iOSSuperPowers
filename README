# ComicList

This repository puts into practice the lessons learned from the iOS SuperPowers module (IV KeepCoding Mobile Bootcamp).

The app serves as a comic explorer using the [ComicVine API](http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/documentation).

In this code we have also learned to architect an iOS app using MVVM pattern, Coordinators and handling asynchronous tasks using RxSwift.
